# Implementation of LeNet-5: Classic CNN for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project provides a clear and practical implementation of the classic LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network architecture. LeNet-5, developed by Yann LeCun et al., is one of the pioneering models in deep learning that demonstrated the power of CNNs on image classification—specifically, handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).

## Project Structure

- `LENET-5.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with the complete model definition, training, evaluation, and sample visualizations.

## Approach

- **Architecture:**  
  Step-by-step construction of the LeNet-5 model using convolutional and pooling layers, leading to fully connected layers and softmax classification.
- **Training:**  
  The model is trained and validated on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST), with plots showing accuracy and loss over epochs.
- **Evaluation:**  
  Model performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.
